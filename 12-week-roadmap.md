12 Week Roadmap for 2026

📍 WEEK 1 - Tech Roles and Market Clarity
Focus: Direction before execution
Before learning anything, decide what you’re learning for.
        • Research roles like AI Engineer, Backend, Full Stack, DevOps
                ○ What do they actually do day-to-day?
                ○ What skills show up repeatedly across job descriptions?
        • Compare skill requirements + salary bands
                ○ Not to chase money blindly, but to understand market demand
        • Identify skill gaps honestly
                ○ What you already know vs what the role expects
        • Join 2-3 high-signal tech communities
                ○ Think quality discussions, not spam or flex posts
