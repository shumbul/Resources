## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

This website is built using a **modular component system** that eliminates code duplication and makes maintenance easier:

### Features
- **Reusable Components:** Header, footer, theme switcher, and navigation are centralized
- **Theme System:** Multi-color theme switcher with persistent preferences
- **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile
- **Component Loading:** Dynamic component loading with caching
- **Template System:** Easy creation of new pages from templates

### Component Structure
```
docs/components/
├── head-common.html      # Common head section with CSS variables
├── theme-switcher.html   # Multi-color theme switcher UI
├── footer.html           # Footer with social links
├── back-nav.html         # Customizable back navigation
├── scripts-common.html   # Common JavaScript functionality
├── component-loader.js   # Component loading utility
├── page-template.html    # Template for creating new pages
└── README.md            # Component documentation
```

### Creating New Pages
```bash
# Use the page creator script
node docs/components/page-creator.js "new-page.html" "Page Title" "Description"

# Or copy the template manually
cp docs/components/page-template.html docs/new-page.html
```

See the [Component Demo](https://shumbul.github.io/Resources/component-demo.html) for a live example of how this system works!
